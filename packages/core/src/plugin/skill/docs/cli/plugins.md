# Plugins

Plugins configured in `redsun.json(c)` that expose a TUI component are loaded automatically by the CLI. To learn how
to build plugins, see [Building plugins](../build/plugins/index.md). You do not need to add the same package to `cli.json`. The CLI
gets the active plugin list from the connected redsun server, so this also works when the server is remote.

Use `cli.json` for CLI-only plugins. These plugins run locally in the terminal and remain active when the CLI connects
to a remote server:

```json title="cli.json"
{
  "plugins": [
    "opencode.example",
    "opencode.example@1.0.0",
    "@example/opencode-tui",
    "@example/opencode-tui@1.0.0",
    "./plugins/status",
    "../plugins/status",
    "/home/user/plugins/status",
    "file:///home/user/plugins/status"
  ]
}
```

Entries are processed in order. Prefix an ID or wildcard with `-` to disable matching plugins:

```json title="cli.json"
{
  "plugins": ["*", "-opencode.notifications", "-team.*"]
}
```

Pass plugin options with the object form:

```json title="cli.json"
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "@example/opencode-tui",
      "options": {
        "compact": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

redsun also discovers plugins under the global config directory and project `.redsun` directories. Each plugin uses
the same layout as a published package, with server and TUI entrypoints kept together.

```text title="Plugin discovery paths"
<global-config>/plugins/status/index.ts
<global-config>/plugins/status/tui.ts
<project>/.redsun/plugins/status/index.ts
<project>/.redsun/plugins/status/tui.ts
```

Discovered plugins can import `@opencode/plugin/tui` directly; redsun resolves the package at runtime. See
[Building CLI plugins](../build/plugins/cli.md) for examples.
