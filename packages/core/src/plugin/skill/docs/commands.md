# Commands

Create `.redsun/commands/review.md` to turn a prompt into `/review`:

```md title=".redsun/commands/review.md"
Review $ARGUMENTS for bugs and missing tests.
```

Run it from the TUI with a target:

```text
/review src/auth.ts
```

redsun submits `Review src/auth.ts for bugs and missing tests.` as a user prompt.

## Markdown

Put global commands in `~/.config/redsun/commands/` and project commands in `.redsun/commands/`.

```text
~/.config/redsun/commands/review.md
.redsun/commands/review.md
```

Only `.md` files are discovered. Nested paths become command names with `/` separators:

```md title=".redsun/commands/team/review.md"
Review $ARGUMENTS using the team's checklist.
```

Run the nested command as `/team/review src/auth.ts`. The legacy singular directories `command/` are also discovered,
but use `commands/` for new files.

Add YAML frontmatter when the command needs metadata. The trimmed Markdown body is always the prompt template.

```md title=".redsun/commands/review.md"
---
description: Review code for correctness
agent: plan
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5#high
---

Review $ARGUMENTS. Report bugs first.
```

## JSON

Define commands under `commands` in any redsun JSON or JSONC [configuration file](config.md). Each command requires a
`template`.

```jsonc title="redsun.jsonc"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "commands": {
    "review": {
      "description": "Review code for correctness",
      "template": "Review $ARGUMENTS. Report bugs first.",
    },
  },
}
```

## Fields

Markdown frontmatter and JSON entries accept the same fields, except that Markdown gets `template` from the file body.

| Field         | Required  | Behavior                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `template`    | JSON only | Prompt template.                                                               |
| `description` | No        | Text shown in command lists and discovery.                                     |
| `agent`       | No        | Agent selected when the command runs.                                          |
| `model`       | No        | Model override in `provider/model` or `provider/model#variant` format.         |
| `subagent`    | No        | `true` runs in a background child session; `false` forces the current session. |
| `subtask`     | No        | Deprecated alias for `subagent`.                                               |

For example, this JSON command sets every current optional field:

```jsonc title="redsun.jsonc"
{
  "commands": {
    "audit": {
      "template": "Audit $ARGUMENTS.",
      "description": "Audit a package",
      "agent": "general",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5#high",
      "subagent": true,
    },
  },
}
```

Do not put `template` in Markdown frontmatter; the body supplies it.

## Arguments

Use `$ARGUMENTS` for the complete argument string exactly as entered.

```md title=".redsun/commands/component.md"
Create a typed React component named $ARGUMENTS.
```

For `/component Account Settings`, the placeholder becomes `Account Settings`.

## Positions

Use `$1`, `$2`, and higher numbers for parsed positional arguments. Single or double quotes group words and are removed.

```md title=".redsun/commands/check.md"
Check $1. Focus on $2.
```

For `/check src/auth.ts "error handling"`, `$1` becomes `src/auth.ts` and `$2` becomes `error handling`.

The highest-numbered placeholder consumes its argument and everything after it. Missing positions become empty strings.

```md title=".redsun/commands/compare.md"
Compare $1 with $2.
```

For `/compare api stable branch`, redsun submits `Compare api with stable branch.`

## Fallback

When a template has no `$ARGUMENTS` or positional placeholder, redsun appends non-empty arguments after a blank line.

```md title=".redsun/commands/explain.md"
Explain this code clearly.
```

For `/explain src/cache.ts`, the prompt becomes:

```text
Explain this code clearly.

src/cache.ts
```

## Shell

Wrap a shell command in `!` followed by backticks to insert its output before the prompt is submitted.

```md title=".redsun/commands/review-diff.md"
Review this diff:

!`git diff --stat && git diff`
```

redsun runs each block with the configured shell in the active project location and inserts its combined output.
Argument placeholders are expanded first:

```md title=".redsun/commands/history.md"
Summarize these commits:

!`git log --oneline -$1`
```

For `/history 5`, the shell receives `git log --oneline -5`. Do not place untrusted arguments inside shell blocks.

> **Warning:** Shell blocks run when redsun evaluates the command, outside the agent's tool permission flow. Only use commands from
> sources you trust.

## Attachments

Stored templates do not expand `@path`; it remains ordinary prompt text.

```md title=".redsun/commands/readme.md"
Review @README.md.
```

To attach a file, add it through the composer when invoking the command. redsun preserves those composer attachments
when it submits the expanded prompt.

## Execution

Commands expand arguments and shell blocks before submitting a durable user prompt. They run in the current session by
default.

```md title=".redsun/commands/plan.md"
---
agent: plan
---

Plan $ARGUMENTS.
```

Running `/plan migration` switches the current session to `plan` before submitting the prompt.

Model selection follows these rules:

1. A command `model` overrides every other model.
2. Otherwise, the selected command agent's configured model overrides the model active at invocation.
3. Otherwise, the current session model remains active.

For example, this command selects both its agent and an explicit model:

```md title=".redsun/commands/design.md"
---
agent: plan
model: openai/gpt-5#high
---

Design $ARGUMENTS.
```

## Background

Set `subagent: true` to run a command in a background child session.

```md title=".redsun/commands/audit.md"
---
description: Audit changes
agent: general
subagent: true
---

Audit $ARGUMENTS for bugs and missing tests.
```

The parent stays available and keeps its agent and model. redsun sends the child's result or failure back to the parent
when the child finishes.

| Value   | Behavior                                                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`  | Always use a child, even when the selected agent has `mode: primary`.              |
| `false` | Always use the current session, even when the selected agent has `mode: subagent`. |
| Omitted | Use a child only when the selected agent has `mode: subagent`.                     |

The child uses the command model, then the selected agent's model, then the parent's model. Legacy `subtask` remains
accepted; if both fields are present, `subagent` wins.

```yaml
subagent: false
subtask: true
```

This example runs in the current session because `subagent` takes precedence.

## Loading

Markdown and JSON commands share one registry. Later sources replace earlier commands with the same name.

```text
~/.config/redsun/commands/review.md   # Lower priority
.redsun/commands/review.md           # Replaces the global command
```

Project sources take precedence over global sources, and nearer project sources take precedence over ancestor sources.
A custom definition can also replace an earlier built-in command. redsun reloads command files and configuration changes
automatically.

```md title=".redsun/commands/review.md"
Review only the staged changes: !`git diff --cached`
```

Saving this file updates `/review` without restarting OpenCode.
